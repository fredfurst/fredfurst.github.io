        <h2>On the Matter of Personal Accounts</h2>
        <p>At this day and age, it is clear that many words have been acquiring a new
            meaning, which may or may not be accompanied by a particular actual
            significance. Personal Accounts, as I am presently referring to them,
            are but the actual information which relates to a user in a computer
            system.

        <h3>As per Alexander</h3>
        <p>Was a particularly tough business to catch up to. Many a man
            had been helped by him, or claimed as much. Understanding and applying
            the oh, so particular, technique touted by Alexander was not easy matter.
        </p>
        <p>The teachers-in-training of yore are now producing work of their own, and 
            the prolific output and results, the consistent and lasting well-being,
            as well as the lack of a clear explanation as to what it actually is...
            All of these are good examples of how unique the whole endeavour really is.

        <h3>As per Quantrionic Physics</h3>
        <p>
            A three-tiered universe as a model, as per the physical (the place where we,
            embodied humans, enmattered humans dwell), the non-physical and mindonic. Of
            course, we dwell in those other two as well, but this one up here seems to
            usually have its volume turned up.
        </p>
        <h3>Computers... and stuff</h3>
        <p>The name of the game is data science and systems integration. BI and so much
            more of what once was distant, unattainable tech is now at hand. A simple
            <a href="README.md">readme.md</a> file can be a valuable marketing tool.
