            <h2>On the Subject Matters at Hand</h2>
            <p>Engineering is seldom seen as a subject of interest to those inhabiting
                a human body. Although most of the human body functions in a manner which
                is simple to understand, the majority of body-inhabiters do take
                most of their decisions and actions from chance, rather than from 
                actual and factual science.
            </p>
            <h3>Conversations Better Left Alone</h3>
            <p>Now suppose that one were to claim, say, that ghosts and goblins were
                real, and that some physicist said he could demonstrate, with pen and
                paper, the reality of the afterlife. Do mind the fact that we don't
                mean necessarily that he will write you a message dictated from afar
                by your deceased loved one.
            </p>
            <h4>Accessibility requires attention</h4>
            <p>I'd never realizaed just how much we all tend to rely on so few senses,
                and yet, most of what we do is either determined by visual or auditive
                stimuli.
            </p>
            <p>There are people who are deprived of the use of such tools, in their current
                condition. Whatever the case may be, there can be what would be called a
                true ressurrection, in some cases.
            </p>
            <h4>Experience and Temperance</h4>
            <p>Ethics is a limit. I mean, look everywhere: some concepts don't exist
                in actual form, but that doesn't automatically imply that they don't
                matter. As long as someone, perhaps a single person, is able to spawn
                and carry an idea around and believe in it, it may be adopted well
                be adopted by others.
            </p>
            <h5>The Facts</h5>
            <p>As per my temperament and inclinations, as well as choices and overall
                evaluations of the world and the particular thread of values we mostly
                see getting flaunted around. We do live in an ostentatious era, but not
                where kings, queens, counts, lords and other pompous names would carry
                weight and change the moods by mere mention.

            <h2>On the Matter of Personal Accounts</h2>
            <p>At this day and age, it is clear that many words have been acquiring a new
                meaning, which may or may not be accompanied by a particular actual
                significance. Personal Accounts, as I am presently referring to them,
                are but the actual information which relates to a user in a computer
                system.

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>This still is, as much as it may not appear so, a social network. Of course
            this is entirely "for show".</p>
            <p>Check it out. Also, check out a cool game at

            <h2>As per Alexander</h2>
            <p>Was a particularly tough business to catch up to. Many a man
                had been helped by him, or claimed as much. Understanding and applying
                the oh, so particular, technique touted by Alexander was not easy matter.
            </p>
            <p>The teachers-in-training of yore are now producing work of their own, and 
                the prolific output and results, the consistent and lasting well-being,
                as well as the lack of a clear explanation as to what it actually is...
                All of these are good examples of how unique the whole endeavour really is.

            <h3>As per Quantrionic Physics</h3>
            <p>
                A three-tiered universe as a model, as per the physical (the place where we,
                embodied humans, enmattered humans dwell), the non-physical and mindonic. Of
                course, we dwell in those other two as well, but this one up here seems to
                usually have its volume turned up.
            </p>
            <h3>Computers... and stuff</h3>
            <p>The name of the game is data science and systems integration. BI and so much
                more of what once was distant, unattainable tech is now at hand. A simple
                readme.md file can be a valuable marketing tool.
